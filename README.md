# site-template
Website template for the new animesoc.co.uk

Uses MaterializeCSS material design framework

This repository exists as a non-functional design guideline for the Animesoc website. Webpages and links are hardcoded purely to view this website design as a proof of concept. This serves as a basic design and style template and will be eventually incorporated into the [main website project](https://github.com/WarwickAnimeSoc/aniMango).
