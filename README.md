# site-template

## This template is for the old [aniMango](https://github.com/WarwickAnimeSoc/aniMango) site, this has now been replaced by [TengenToppaAnimango](https://github.com/WarwickAnimeSoc/TengenToppaAnimango) which uses a different CSS framework, therefore this design is no logner current.

Website template for the new animesoc.co.uk

Uses MaterializeCSS material design framework

This repository exists as a non-functional design guideline for the Animesoc website. Webpages and links are hardcoded purely to view this website design as a proof of concept. This serves as a basic design and style template and will be eventually incorporated into the [main website project](https://github.com/WarwickAnimeSoc/aniMango).
